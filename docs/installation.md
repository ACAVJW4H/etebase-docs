These docs currently refer to the TypeScript/JavaScript client library, but they will be expanded once we release the other clients.

## Building the package

Etebase is currently still in beta, so it's not yet available on NPM or a CDN, however you can install it directly from source.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/etesync/etebase-js/
cd etebase-js
yarn && yarn build  # install dependencies and build
```

## Using the package in your project

You can then just install the package directly from your computer, e.g:

```shell
cd your-project
yarn add /path/to/etebase-js
```
