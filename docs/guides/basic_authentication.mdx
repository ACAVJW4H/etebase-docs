Etebase automatically takes care of the encryption for you, securely deriving an encryption key from the user password. It then also creates an asymmetric keypair to login so the password never leaves the user's device.

:::important
Please note that all of the operations in this page are slow and may take a few seconds to complete depending on your device. This is because Etebase **purpusefully** uses a slow function ([Argon2id](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argon2)) to derive a secure encryption key from the user password.

Luckily they can be avoided almost entirely for most use-cases. Pleaes take a look at [session save and restore](#session-save-and-restore) for more information.

## Signup

Sign up is just one easy call which returns an instance of the etebase client.

<CodeTabs>
<TabItem value="js">

```js
const etebase = await Etebase.Account.signup("username", "password");
```

</TabItem>
</CodeTabs>


## Login

Login is too just one easy call which returns an instance of the etebase client.

<CodeTabs>
<TabItem value="js">

```js
const etebase = await Etebase.Account.login("username", "password");
```

</TabItem>
</CodeTabs>


## Change password

Unlike signup and login, changing password requires an already set up client.

<CodeTabs>
<TabItem value="js">

```js
await etebase.changePassword("new password");
```

</TabItem>
</CodeTabs>

## Session save and restore

Most apps can't, or don't want the user to enter their passwords every time they are opened, that's why Etebase supports saving and restoring sessions.

Saving and restoring a session is as simple as:

<CodeTabs>
<TabItem value="js">

```js
const etebase = await Etebase.Account.login("username", "password");
const savedSession = await etebase.save();

// Later on...
const etebase = await Etebase.Account.restore(savedSession);
```

</TabItem>
</CodeTabs>
